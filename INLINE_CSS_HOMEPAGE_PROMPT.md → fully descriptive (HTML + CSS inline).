Prompt:

*"Write a complete, clean, and responsive HTML homepage code with inline CSS. The page should include:

A blue top navigation bar (.menu) with shadow, padding, and evenly spaced menu items (Home, Programming, Tutorials, PDF Gallery, Quiz, Create Result Sheet).

Navigation links should have white text, bold font, right-side borders (except the last one), and a hover effect that changes background to white and text to black.

The menu should be responsive: on smaller screens, the items stack vertically, and borders switch from right-side to bottom borders.

Add a container with max width 950px and centered layout.

Add a styled header with cyan background, rounded border, shadow, and centered text.

Add a .srti section with blue heading and a bordered paragraph (50% width).

Add a .footer with right-aligned admin info in a styled .admin-box (soft background, border, shadow).

Ensure the code is fully responsive using @media queries.
Return the full HTML code with inline CSS inside a single <style> block."*
